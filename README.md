# D3bot

Everything redone from scratch:
This version will be built from ground up to reduce computational resources, enable more complex bot behavior and improve path generation from navmeshes.

## Compatibility

This will for the most part be incompatible with the previous version of D3bot.
There will be importers/converters for the old navmeshes at some later point in time. But for now the navmeshes have to be redone.
